Problem
1) demand predictions don't fit
2) cause
   a) error in  estimation code
   b) error in simulation  code
   c) error in analysis of results
   d) mis-specification
   e) lack of convergence
3) checks
   a) MC with small K and J.
      i) are parameters recovered
      ii) compare data and prediction
   b) check code
   c) is e normal?
   d) is dim(eta) = 2
   e) integration rule: use diffe nodes for HH

4) demand predictions hit some spikes for some goods but overpredict for many
    a) convergence to local optimizer with mue too big??
        i) try different starting point with small mue?? and small variance of
e? combined with big factor loadings?
    b) increase dimension of eta???
    c) model e as micture of normals??
    d) sensitive to integration rule??
