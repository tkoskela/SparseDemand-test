Problem
1) demand predictions don't fit
2) cause
   a) error in  estimation code
   b) error in simulation  code
   c) error in analysis of results
   d) mis-specification
   e) lack of convergence
3) checks
   a) MC with small K and J.
      i) are parameters recovered
      ii) compare data and prediction
   b) check code
   c) is e normal?
   d) is dim(eta) = 2
   e) integration rule: use diffe nodes for HH
